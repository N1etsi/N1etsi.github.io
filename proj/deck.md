#Volume deck/USB Hub
After seeing some decks done with [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) I wanted to do something with it. So I made one with 5 channels (One for master output, another for microphone input and three others for other apps) and integrated a USB hub in the 3D printed case I designed and printed on my Ender 3 Pro.
