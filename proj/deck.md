# Volume deck/USB Hub
After seeing some projects done with [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) I wanted to make something similar for myself using it. So I designed and printed my own enclosure and integrated an USB Hub + SD card reader into it. The deck itself has 5 programmable sliders , the first one I use for the Master volume control, the second for voice chat apps, like Discord or Skype, the third on is for music apps (in this case I only have it configured for the Spotify App) and the fourth controls every other app. Finally, the fifth slider controls my microphone volume.
