#F1 Fantasy
In order to get better strats to this game I have devoloped a small program that fetches data from the game and updates a Google Sheets page that does some stats and graphing.
[Google Sheets - F1 Fantasy Hub](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmA_JHysK1Y7Dl2Zy5tCJkKXl62h5QHN8RkY48WBaHY/edit?usp=sharing)

There's also a quick and dirty [website](n1etsi.space/fantasy) with some graphs, but it's far from being anything polished
